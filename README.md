# Speed-extraction
Code for speed extraction of players in football videos. 

# Dependencies
The code runs with python 3.10, but potentially with other versions too. The repo was used in ml-node (https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/kompetansehuber/uio-ai-hub-node-project/it-resources/ml-nodes/), which meant pip was not accessible for all installations, however, the following packages were downloaded from ml-node itsel:
- **PyTorch**: 1.7.0
- **bzip2**: 1.0.8
- **FFmpeg**: 4.4.2

The other packages can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
